Welcome to my website! My name is Cole Graber-Mitchell (cgm616) and I'm a
student at Amherst College in Massachusetts. I'm originally from Minneapolis,
Minnesota.

I enjoy politics, programming, and problem solving. While I haven't managed
to combine those yet, I love to doorknock and phonebank for progressive causes
and candidates.

In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, tweeting angrily into the void, and
writing columns for Amherst's student newspaper.
