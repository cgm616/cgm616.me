Welcome to cgm616's website. You access posts by clicking on the links above.

I'm a highschooler in Minnesota, and I like messing around with computers and trying out new things.
This website was mostly created just to try out Metalsmith as a static site generator.
Also, my prevous website looked terrible and loaded too slowly.
You can read more about the technologies behind this website in the article titled "How this website is built."

I enjoy programming with Rust most of all, and I'm trying out Racket and Elm.
Most of all, I like to learn and problem solve things I haven't done before.
