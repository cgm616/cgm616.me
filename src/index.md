Welcome to my website! My name is Cole Graber-Mitchell (cgm616) and I'm a college
student at Amherst College in Massachusetts, originally from Minneapolis,
Minnesota.

I enjoy politics, programming, and problem solving. I'm most comfortable in the
Rust programming language, but I occasionally dabble in others as well. Other than
my main interests, I also have fun with photography, ukulele, and theatre.
